<h2>Microsoft .NET Framework SDK version 2.0 Samples Download Readme</h2>
 
<p>Thank you for downloading the latest version of the Microsoft® .NET Framework SDK version 2.0 samples. This download includes Technology and Application samples that ship with the .NET Framework SDK, along with updates to these samples that were not included in the .NET Framework SDK v2.0 version.</p>

<p>To use the samples, you first must install the .NET Framework version 2.0 redistributable and the .NET Framework SDK 2.0, which are both available on the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=55571" target="_new">Download Center</a>. Note that this samples download file does not include the SQLCLR samples. The latest version of these samples are available online at the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=55572" target="_new">SQL Server Samples Downloads page</a></p>  

<B>How to set up your environment to build and run the samples</b><BR>
The .NET Framework Samples require environment variable values to be specified on your computer. The variables are initialized when you start the SDK Command Prompt.<P>

You can set these variables in a variety of ways, depending on your personal preferences. The .NET Framework SDK setup program does not set these variables on your computer.<P>

The required values are provided by the sdkvars.bat batch file located in one of the following directories, depending on whether you installed Microsoft Visual Studio 2005:<br>
<UL>
<LI>Program Files\Microsoft.NET\SDK\v2.0\bin
<LI>Program Files\Visual Studio 8\SDK\v2.0\bin
</UL>
<BR>
The SDK Command Prompt calls the SDKVars.bat batch file, located in the Program Files\Microsoft.NET\SDK\v2.0\Bin directory. Note that the variables expire when you close the command prompt window.<P>

To make the settings permanent, you can append the variable values to your environment variables by using the My Computer properties.<P>

<B>How to start the .NET Framework SDK Command Prompt</B><BR>
Click Start, point to All Programs, point to Microsoft .NET Framework SDK v2.0, and then click SDK Command Prompt.
